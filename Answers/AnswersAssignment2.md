## Step by Step

**Question 1A:** Which variables are depicted in which manner? 

1. The first results column (?drugLabel) is depicted on the horizontal (x) axis.
1. The second results column (?geneLabel) is depicted on the vertical (y) axis.
1. The third results column (?biological_processLabel) is depicted as a colour code on the data points.
1. The fourth results column (?diseaseLabel) is visualised in the top left corner.

With this data visualisation option, one can only visualise the results of 4 variables simultaneously.

**Question 1B:** What would change to the visualisation, if you switch the place of the variables ?geneLabel and ?biological_processLabel ?

This would switch the data on the verticalaxis, with the data depicted by the colour codes. Choosing which result is display in which column has an effect on the interpretability of your data plot.
