Assignment 2: Which variant of which gene predicts a positive prognosis in colorectal cancer
=================

During this assignment, we will investigate another example SPARQL query of Wikidata, called ["Find drugs for cancers that target genes related to cell proliferation"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Find_drugs_for_cancers_that_target_genes_related_to_cell_proliferation). We will first go through the basics of a SPARQL query. Second, we will find out how to execute the query and retain or share results. Last, we will expand the query and make other (small) changes, to understand the structure of a SPARQL query better, and see what other data is available in Wikidata.

## Step by Step

We will use the following [example](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Find_drugs_for_cancers_that_target_genes_related_to_cell_proliferation), which makes use of Gene Ontology terms in Wikidata.
