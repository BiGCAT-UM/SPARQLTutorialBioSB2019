# SPARQLTutorialsSB2019
Setup for the proposed BioSB 2019 tutorial on SPARQL.
BioSB [website](https://www.biosb.nl/2018/12/biosb-2019-call-for-breakout-sessions/) with more info. Deadline: 14th of January.

Required info:
1. Your name (and names of potential co-organizers)
1. Description of the topic and a title for the session
1. Objectives of the session
1. Target audience

Information for BioSb:

1. Denise Slenter, Marvin Martens, Egon Willighagen
1. Title: SPARQLing Biology; a beginners course. Description: More biological databases are being offered in the so called Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, which is a flexible way of sharing data in a machine readable manner. SPARQL is a (semantic) query language for these databases, allowing to find information within the RDF data. 
1. During this tutorial, the basics of RDF and SPARQL will be explained in a lecture. Later, a handson session is planned with some biological examples from the [Wikidata SPARQL website](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples). Two key examples which will be discussed, are: ["Which variant of which gene predicts a positive prognosis in colorectal cancer"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Which_variant_of_which_gene_predicts_a_positive_prognosis_in_colorectal_cancer) and ["Find drugs for cancers that target genes related to cell proliferation"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Find_drugs_for_cancers_that_target_genes_related_to_cell_proliferation). These examples can be modified during the handon session, to allow for direct implementation for the field of interest of the participants.
1. This tutorial will be at a basic level; therefore you do not need programming skills to work with SPARQL queries. Understanding which biological questions to ask is more important.


Setup for the proposed Metabolomics 2019 tutorial on SPARQL.
Metabolomics [website](http://www.metabolomics2019.org/) with more info. Deadline: 7th of January (applied 2018-01-02).

Information for organisers:

1. Email address: denise.slenter@maastrichtuniveristy.com
1. Suggested Workshop Title: SPARQLing Biology; a beginners course.
1. Workshop Description / Abstract: During this tutorial, the basics of RDF and SPARQL will be explained in a lecture. Later, a handson session is planned with some biological examples from the [Wikidata SPARQL website](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples). These examples will be related to Metabolomics data.
**Additional info for abstract (not send in yet): Two key examples which will be discussed, are: ["	Chemical elements and their properties"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Chemical_elements_and_their_properties) and ["Metabolite-metabolite interactions (mostly conversions) and their pKa change"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Metabolite-metabolite_interactions_(mostly_conversions)_and_their_pKa_change). These examples can be modified during the handon session, to allow for direct implementation for the field of interest of the participants.**
1. Rationale for Workshop: More biological databases are being offered in the so called Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, which is a flexible way of sharing data in a machine readable manner. SPARQL is a (semantic) query language for these databases, allowing to find information within the RDF data. 
1. Workshop Organizer - Name: BiGCaT - Bioinformatics
1. Workshop Organizer - Company/Organization: Maastricht University
1. Workshop Organizer - Email (we will correspond with this person): denise.slenter@maastrichtuniversity.nl
1. Presenter(s): Denise Slenter, Egon Willighagen
1. Workshop Format (traditional workshop, panel session, peer session, etc.) : traditional workshop
1. Suggested Duration (duration will be determined by conference agenda, likely 90 minute – 2 hour sessions): 2 hours preferred; however 90 minutes is also doable.
1. Ideal Number of Participants (tell us your ideal number and if there are any restrictions ("not more than 30", "Early Career Researchers only", “no maximum”, etc.): Max of 30 (since we only have 2 instructors available).
1.Equipment Needed (basic AV will be provided: screen, projector, microphones, etc. If attendees need to bring a laptop to participate, please indicate here.): Laptop with internet connection
1. Other Comments: This tutorial will be at a basic level; therefore you do not need programming skills to work with SPARQL queries. Understanding which biological questions to ask is more important.
