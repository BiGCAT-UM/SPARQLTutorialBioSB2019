# SPARQLTutorialBioSB2019
Setup for the proposed BioSb2019 tutorial on SPARQL.
BioSb [website](https://www.biosb.nl/2018/12/biosb-2019-call-for-breakout-sessions/) with more info. Deadline: 14th of January.

Required info:
1. Your name (and names of potential co-organizers)
1. Description of the topic and a title for the session
1. Objectives of the session
1. Target audience

Information for BioSb:

1. Denise Slenter, Marvin Martens, Egon Willighagen
1. Title: SPARQLing Biology; a beginners course. Description: More biological databases are being offered in the socalled Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, which is a flexible way of sharing data in a machine readable manner. SPARQL is a (semantic) query language for these databases, allowing to. 
1. During this tutorial, the basics of RDF and SPARQL will be explained in a lecture. Later, a handson session is planned with some biological examples from the [Wikidata SPARQL website](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples). Two key examples which will be discussed, are: ["Which variant of which gene predicts a positive prognosis in colorectal cancer"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Which_variant_of_which_gene_predicts_a_positive_prognosis_in_colorectal_cancer) and ["Find drugs for cancers that target genes related to cell proliferation"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#Find_drugs_for_cancers_that_target_genes_related_to_cell_proliferation). These examples can be modified during the handon session, to allow for direct implementation for the field of interest of the participants.
1. This tutorial will be at a basic level; therefore you do not need programming skills to work with SPARQL queries. Understanding which biological questions to ask is more important.
